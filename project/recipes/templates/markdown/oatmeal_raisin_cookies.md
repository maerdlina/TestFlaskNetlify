## Oatmeal Raisin Cookies

Oatmeal raisin cookies are chewy and sweet.  These cookies are one of my favorite cookie recipes.

## Description

The sweetness from the raisins and brown sugar, the hint of cinnamon, and the texture of the oats makes this a great cookie recipe.

I've read a lot of recipes for oatmeal raisin cookies and I think the description of "soft and chewy" is perfect for these cookies.

This recipe makes about 3 dozen cookies.

## Tips

Don't over-mix the batter once the flour has been incorporated, as this can make the dough tough. 

An ice cream scoop is good for getting out even-sized balls of dough onto the cookie sheet. 

If the butter isn't at room temperature, put the butter in the microwave for about 35 seconds to warm it up.
