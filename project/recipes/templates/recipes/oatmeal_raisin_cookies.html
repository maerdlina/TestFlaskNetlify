<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The sweetness from the raisins and brown sugar, the hint of cinnamon, and the texture of the oats makes this a great cookie recipe.</p>
<p>I've read a lot of recipes for oatmeal raisin cookies and I think the description of "soft and chewy" is perfect for these cookies.</p>
<p>This recipe makes about 3 dozen cookies.</p>

{% block recipe_tips %}
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Don't over-mix the batter once the flour has been incorporated, as this can make the dough tough. </p>
<p>An ice cream scoop is good for getting out even-sized balls of dough onto the cookie sheet. </p>
<p>If the butter isn't at room temperature, put the butter in the microwave for about 35 seconds to warm it up.</p>
